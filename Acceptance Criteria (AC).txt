As a user, I should be able to manage my todos effectively.

Acceptance Criteria:
Add a To-Do: The user should be able to enter a task and add it to the list. 
(type your to do task "eat" and press enter, ensure 'All' and 'Active' tab have your to do task)


Mark To-Do as Completed: The user should be able to mark a task as completed.  
(ensure 'Completed' tab should have the completed task where the checkbox is clicked with a strike on it and 'Active' tab don't have the completed task)


Delete a To-Do: The user should be able to remove a task from the list.  
(by clicking the X while mouse hover the to do task added and check if the task is not present in All tab anymore)


Filter To-Dos: The user should be able to filter tasks (All, Active, Completed). 
(add at least 3 todos and navigate all the tabs and return the tasks)

(no response if no input and pressed ENTER- dont support)
